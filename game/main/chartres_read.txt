Description:	A cathedral map based on Chartres. This construction shows 
		blatant disregard for anything even remotely associated with standard 		mapping principles. If you are looking for a exciting fast paced
		DM ,..move along! :) This was done out of love for the architecture 			involed and should be viewed as such.(2 players).

Thanks to:	ttimo and crew for all the effort with Radiant
		id for the quake series.
				
		BETA/PLAY TESTING:
		everyone at quake3world for the 
		tireless support during an insanely
		long development
		
		Allison Stone, for her wonderful resources
		Dr. Jeffery Howe, for all the research, and resources.

* gameplay *

general: this was NOT constructed to be a deathmatch level, 
	 it was constructed to see if it could be done.
	 Gameplay is sluggish at best, but multplayer support is provided
	 I would suggest LAN play against a real player, bots are 
	 not very good at navigating this map.
weapons: 2 rail guns

bots	: not very good :(
