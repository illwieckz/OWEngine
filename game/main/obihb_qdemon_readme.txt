Model Name:		QDemon


Model Information:
------------------

After the Shambler I wanted to make another Quake monster for Doom3. One of
my other favourite monsters was the Demon. So here is my remake of this classic
Quake monster.

This model was modelled and animated in 3D Studio Max and the textures created
in Adobe Photoshop. The normal map was rendered with the renderbump function
from within the Doom3 engine.

Model and animations exported with the MD5 exporter from der_ton. Visit
Doom3World to find this plugin or more info about it.
