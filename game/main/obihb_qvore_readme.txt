Model Name:		QVore


Model Information:
------------------

This is another remake of an old Quake monster, the Vore. It was just an
interesting design for a monster and I wanted to see what I can come up
with as a new and updated version for the Doom3 engine.

It was definately the one I struggled with the most while making the high
polygon version but I think ended up with something decent. Or rather I
hope it ended up looking fairly decent.

Model and animations exported with the MD5 exporter from der_ton. Visit
Doom3World to find this plugin or more info about it.
