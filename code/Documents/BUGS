Known OWEngine bugs:
- car physics is jittery on triangle meshes (internal edges issue, known for a very long time for Bullet Physics users)
- there are several Bullet-related memory leaks, most of them will be fixed soon
- obsolete Com_Error mechanism (setjmp, etc) crashes sometimes; Com_Error handling code should be rewritten soon
